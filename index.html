            Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed
            world. The longer you live, the more you realize that the only
            things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain. suffering

            there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. As
            long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also
            exist.
